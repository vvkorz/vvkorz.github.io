    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Here is what I did to earn my engineering degree in <a href="http://www.bmstu.ru/en/">Bauman Moscow State Technical University (BMSTU)</a>.</p>
<p>The title of my thesis is «Vacuum evaporation machine of Osmium films». During the last two years of my university&rsquo;s studies in Moscow all my term papers have been dedicated to different parts of this system. All papers were written in Russian language and here I just briefly describe the machine.</p>
<p>In general the task was to redesign an existing vacuum machine, from which I reused only the main chamber with all its units and technical parts including the vacuum system being redesigned.
The major function of this machine is to etch and deposit the Osmium film on the emitting surface of cathodes of various designs. To meet different requirements of cathode production technology multiple technological regimes of etching were developed.
The described system is constructed for maintenance of various regimes of etching, both with high, and low speed, and also with maintenance of the minimum non-uniformity of the film.</p>
<p>Given the constrained parameters and dimensions of cathodes I have created various layout diagrams of the system. The carousel type of the machine proved to be the most suitable.
I have chosen magnetron as an evaporating system and calculated it&rsquo;s parameters on the basis of the required Osmium film properties.
On the ground of these calculations, I have developed the design of intra-chamber equipment determining the place of the basic technological units and choosing the pattern of cartridge with cathodes motion.
Due to the optimal location of the essential units, the design of the vacuum chamber provides normal functioning of the machine and ease in maintenance.
The kinematic calculations were performed in Matlab simulating different transmission ratios, necessary frequency of electric motors, carousel rotation, as well as the basic threaded connections.
Besides, the vacuum system has been developed to achieve required vacuum levels. Calculating the time of pumping I took into account sorption and desorption of the gases on the walls of the chamber.
Putting the principles of ease in maintenance, I have arranged the configuration of vacuum system on a carrying frame.
To choose the most rational variants of purchased parts (that is pumps, flanged connections, current feed throughs, valves and etc.), within the limits of the project, I have carried out the analysis of the construction and properties of these parts of vacuum system.</p>
<p>This is how the machine looked like at the end:</p>

<p>The resulting machine was successfully exploited in the experimental production unit of the <a href="https://www.toriy.ru/">&ldquo;Toriy&rdquo; Company</a> in Moscow.</p>
