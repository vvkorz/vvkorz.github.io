      <description>This is a pure theoretical work in innovation economics and economics of technology. It describes forces that lead to the appearance of so called general purpose technology (GPT) in the economy (think of electricity or information and communication technology (ICT) as examples). These technologies find applications in various sectors of economy transforming the way people work and adding economic value. My work demonstrates that under certain conditions four forces might lead to a formation of such a general knowledge.</description>

      <description>This is one of my first projects making use of machine learning for text classification. In order to analyse technological innovations in Germany for my PhD thesis, robotics patents were classified into service and industrial classes. You can find a detailed description and results in the following paper . The project was done in the Institute for Economics ( ECON ) in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology together with Dr. Florian H.</description>

      <description>This project focused on the detection of factors influencing collaboration among academic institutions in the field of nanotechnology. More than 300.000 publications were analysed together with supplementary data to predict the appearence of collaboration links among organisations working in nanotechnology field in Germany.&#xA;I used negative binomial and logistic regressions predicting co-authorship links. This work was done at the Faculty of Technology Policy and Management of the Delft University of Technology and published in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics.</description>

      <description>In general the task was a redesign of an existing vacuum machine, from which I, basically, reused only the main body with all its units and technical parts including the vacuum system being redesigned by me. The major function of this machine is to etch and deposit the Osmium film on the emitting surface of cathodes of various constructions and designs. To meet different requirements of cathode production technology multiple technological regimes of etching were developed.</description>
