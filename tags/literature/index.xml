He was a Swiss author and dramatist in XX century. So far I red three of his books and quite enjoyed all of them:
The Physicists. I recommend to read it in german, if possible. It is a satiric drama that reflects on the times of the Cold War. Apparently, this is one of the most played theater pieces in German speaking Switzerland, Germany and Austria.</description></item></channel></rss>
