The partition complexity can be varied and can greatly change how your resulting image looks like. To learn more about the partition complexity and the algorithmic approach, check out section &amp;ldquo;Algorithm description&amp;rdquo;.
The Mondrian generator has the possibility to generate two styles of Mondrian-inspired images:</description></item><item><title>Magic mirror</title><link>https://vvkorz.github.io/posts/magicmirror/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://vvkorz.github.io/posts/magicmirror/</guid><description>This is my private version of the magic mirror. The code is a well known open source project from MichMich.
