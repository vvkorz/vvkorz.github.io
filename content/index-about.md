Hi, I’m Vladimir! I’m an engineer specializing in creating and deploying machine learning solutions for the manufacturing industry. In my free time, I love hanging out with my family and my dog, Yoki, and tinkering with Raspberry Pis.  

This is where I share my projects, ideas, and thoughts on different topics. Whether you’re here to check out my work, connect, or learn more about me, I’m happy you’re here. Let’s get started!
