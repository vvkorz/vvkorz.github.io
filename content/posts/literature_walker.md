Just finished reading a book `Why We Sleep` by [Matthew Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Walker_(scientist)). It highlights the importance of sleep and can largely be summarized in a sentence: Sleep more and you will improve the probability of success in all aspects of life.

Most practical advice about the methods on improving sleep quality I found in Chapter 14:

*"The obvious methods involve reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, removing screen technology from the bedroom, and having a cool bedroom. In addition, patients must (1) establish a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends, (2) go to bed only when sleepy and avoid sleeping on the couch early/mid-evenings, (3) never lie awake i bed for a significant time period; rather, get out of bed and do something quite and relaxing until the urge to sleep returns, (4) avoid daytime napping if you are having difficulty sleeping at night, (5) reduce anxiety-provoking thoughts and worries by learning to mentally decelerate before bed, and (6) remove visible clockfaces from the view in the bedroom, preventing clock-watching anxiety at night."*
