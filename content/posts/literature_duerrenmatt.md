Recently, I discovered a new author for myself: [Friedrich Duerrenmatt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_D%C3%BCrrenmatt). He was a Swiss author and dramatist in XX century. So far I red three of his books and quite enjoyed all of them:

- [The Physicists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Physicists). I recommend to read it in german, if possible. It is a satiric drama that reflects on the times of the Cold War. Apparently, this is one of the most played theater pieces in German speaking Switzerland, Germany and Austria. 
- [Die Richter und sein Henker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Judge_and_His_Hangman) (*The Judge and his Hangman*) is one of the classics of crime fictions. It reminded me somehow on famous German television show [Tatort](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatort_(Fernsehreihe)), that I used to watch a lot to learn German (and a bit of German culture)
- [Der Verdacht](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Verdacht_(D%C3%BCrrenmatt)) (*Suspicion*) is continuation of the book above. Again a very nice crime fiction for evening read, in case you enjoy books like that.
