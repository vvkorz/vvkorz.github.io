This is one of my first projects making use of machine learning for text classification. In order to analyse technological innovations in Germany for my PhD thesis, robotics patents were classified into service and industrial classes.
You can find a detailed description and results in the following <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2268-3"> paper </a>.
The project was done in the Institute for Economics (<a href="https://wipo.econ.kit.edu/"> ECON </a>) in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology together with Dr. Florian H. Kreuchauff under the supervision of the <a href="https://wipo.econ.kit.edu/87.php">Prof. Dr. Ingrid Ott</a>.
