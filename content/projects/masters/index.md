This project focused on the detection of factors influencing collaboration among academic institutions in the field of nanotechnology.
More than 300.000 publications were analysed together with supplementary data to predict the appearence of collaboration links among organisations working in nanotechnology field in Germany.

I used negative binomial and logistic regressions predicting co-authorship links.
This work was done at the [Faculty of Technology Policy and Management](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/tpm/) of the Delft University of Technology and published in the Journal of Evolutionary Economics. Read the [following paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00191-019-00605-2)
