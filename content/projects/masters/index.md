This project focused on the detection of factors influencing collaboration among academic institutions in the field of nanotechnology.
More than 300.000 publications were analysed together with supplementary data to predict the appearence of collaboration links among organisations working in nanotechnology field in Germany.

I used negative binomial and logistic regressions predicting co-authorship links.
