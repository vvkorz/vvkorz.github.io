This is theoretical work in innovation economics and economics of technology. The work was done in the [Institute for Economics (ECON)](https://wipo.econ.kit.edu/) in Karlsruhe Institute of Technology together with [PD Dr. Ivan Savi](https://wipo.econ.kit.edu/21_874.php) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Ingrid Ott](https://wipo.econ.kit.edu/87.php).

The idea was to model forces that might lead to the appearance of so called [general purpose technology (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_technology) in the economy. One can think of electricity or information and communication technology (IT) as examples. These technologies find applications in various sectors of economy transforming the way people work and add economic value.

My work demonstrates that under certain conditions four forces might lead to a formation of such a general knowledge.
You can find a detailed description and results in the following [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2017.12.011).

The work is largely inspired by:

- what later became [the observatory of economic complexity](https://oec.world)
- the book [General Purpose Technologies and Economic Growth](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/general-purpose-technologies-and-economic-growth)
- the book [Economic Transformations: General Purpose Technologies and Long Term Economic Growth](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B004MKLUEY/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_r8kgDbB2KYWCP)
